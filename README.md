# AA awakening calculator

This is an Flask app that uses Ajax/Jquery in the frontend to send user input and update without refreshing.

1.) Create a new virtualenv and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

2.) Run the app: `python awkcalc.py`

3.) Open your browser to http://127.0.0.1:5000 to view the app.

The `awk.py` file contains all python code, and the frontend code for the jQuery version is contained in the `templates/base.html` file
